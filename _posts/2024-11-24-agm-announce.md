Our Annual General Meeting and strategy meeting will be at 2pm, 8th December. 
We'll be in the Brisbane Square Library Theatrette, on Reddacliffe in the city. 

Come along, meet our volunteer team, and help us dream up what our next year of campaigning for a bigger and better Brisbane will look like!
